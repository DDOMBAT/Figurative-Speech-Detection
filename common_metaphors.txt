My teacher is a dragon
Their home was a prison
Life is a roller coaster
America is a melting pot
His eyes were ice
The world is a stage
Life is a fashion show
Time is money
Laughter is the music of the soul
The peaceful lake was a mirror
Your brain is a computer
The car was a furnace in the son
The park was a lake after the rain
The lawn is a green carpet
The kids were monkeys on the jungle gym
The stars are sparkling diamonds
My brother is a couch potato
The clouds are balls of cotton
His stomach is a black hole
His heart is a rock
The interstate was a parking lot at rush hour
Books are the keys to your imagination
The ballerina was a swan
Her angry words were bullets to him
The thunder was a lion
The road was a ribbon stretching across the desert.

Love is sex 
Love is sexual desire
Love is a emotion
Love is a nutrient
Love is a journey
Love is a fluid in a container
Love is fire
Love is an economic exchange
Love is a natural force
Love is a physical force
Love is a captive animal
Love is war
Love is a social superior
Love is rapture
Love is a thrill ride
Love is a fine wine
Love is a garden
Love is a battlefield
Love is an experiment
Love is a fragile flower opening to the warmth of spring
Love is a lemon â€“ either bitter or sweet
